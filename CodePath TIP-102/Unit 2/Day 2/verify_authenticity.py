Problem 2: Verifying Authenticity
Your art gallery has just been shipped a new collection of numbered art pieces, and you need to verify their authenticity. 
The collection is considered "authentic" if it is a permutation of an array base[n].

The base[n] array is defined as [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n], meaning it is an array of length n + 1 containing the integers from 1 to n - 1 
exactly once, and the integer n twice. For example, base[1] is [1, 1] and base[3] is [1, 2, 3, 3].

Write a function is_authentic_collection that accepts an array of integers art_pieces and returns True if the given array is an authentic array, 
and otherwise returns False.

Note: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers. For example [3, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 3] are both permutations of the series 
of numbers 1, 2, and 3.

def is_authentic_collection(art_pieces):
    pass
    
Example Usage:
collection1 = [2, 1, 3]
collection2 = [1, 3, 3, 2]
collection3 = [1, 1]

print(is_authentic_collection(collection1))
print(is_authentic_collection(collection2))
print(is_authentic_collection(collection3))

Example Output:
False
Example 1 Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only 
candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. 
However, base[3] has four elements but array collection1 has three. Therefore, 
it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.

True
Example 2 Explanation:  Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only 
candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. 
It can be seen that collection2 is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] 
(by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]).
Therefore, the answer is true.

True
Example 3 Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 1, 
the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], 
is n = 1. It can be seen that collection3 is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1].
Therefore, the answer is true.
