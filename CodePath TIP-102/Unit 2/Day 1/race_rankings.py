Problem 6: Time Portal Race Rankings
A group of time travelers are competing in a series of races to see who can hop through time portals the fastest, 
from the medieval era to the year 4050. You're given a list of race outcomes in the form of an integer array races, 
where each element races[i] = [winner, loser] indicates that the traveler winner defeated the traveler loser in a race.

Write a function find_travelers() that accepts the integer array races as a parameter and returns a list answer of length 2 where:
answer[0] is a list of all travelers who have not lost any races.
answer[1] is a list of all travelers who have lost exactly one race.

Both the input list races and your output list answer should be sorted in increasing order.

Note: Only include travelers who have competed in at least one race â€” that is, those who appear as either a winner 
or a loser in the input list races. For example, if races = [[1,2], [5, 6], that may imply the existence of racers 3 and 4. 
However, since neither racer 3 nor 4 is included in the input list, 3 and 4 should also not appear in the output list answer.

def find_travelers(races):
    pass
    
Example Usage:
races1 = [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 6], [5, 6], [5, 7], [4, 5], [4, 8], [4, 9], [10, 4], [10, 9]]
races2 = [[2, 3], [1, 3], [5, 4], [6, 4]]

print(find_travelers(races1))  
print(find_travelers(races2)) 

Example Output:
[[1, 2, 10], [4, 5, 7, 8]]
[[1, 2, 5, 6], []]
